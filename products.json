A little tropical, a little timeless, and very easy to love.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light</strong> - Moderate light - ideally, this plant wants to sit in a spot where she'll get bright sun in the morning, and diffused light through the afternoon. Usually eastern or southern exposure works best.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Water</strong> - Water when the top inch of soil is nearly dry to the touch. For palms, specifically, avoid hard water or water rich in minerals. If you notice browning foliage tips, try watering with distilled water.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fun Fact</strong> - This plant is called a \"parlor\" palm because\u00a0it was a very popular plant in English parlors during the Victorian period.</p>",

Peace Lilies are very slow drinkers, and you\u2019ll probably find that you\u2019re watering your plant every 8 - 12 days, depending on the light and warmth in your home. Peace Lily leaves will begin to droop if the plant becomes very dry but will pop right back up after a drink.

Always cut your flowers at an angle so they can absorb more water &amp; won\u2019t suffocate on the bottom of the vase. After the initial cut, check the bottoms of your stems every couple of days, and if the ends are looking a bit slimy, just snip off an inch or so.</p><p><strong>3) Remove Leaves:</strong> Take off any excess leaves so that all the water is funneled into the petals. Pay special attention to leaves below the water line because they\u2019ll decompose, causing rot and bacteria to grow, which will shorten the lifespan of your blooms.</p><p><strong>4) Remove Spent Blooms:</strong> Any flowers that are past their prime release ethylene gas which will age the flowers around them. Remove any flowers that are beginning to wilt to keep the rest of your bouquet fresh and happy.</p><p><strong>5) Keep Them Cool:</strong> Last but not least, keep your flowers in a cool area.

(Pro tip: remove any foliage near or below the waterline for a longer-lasting bouquet!)</p>",

    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Add warmth and purity to any space courtesy of the blissful and aptly named Pearl bouquet. Featuring lush white peonies, each with a delicate pink center, the arrangement is a special treat for the warmer months. They arrive in compact bulb form, eventually thriving and developing into the pillow-like blooms. Read more about the meaning of the white peony. Choose from three bouquet sizes of lush peonies, a 10-stem Single, a 20-stem Double, or a 30-stem Triple.<br/><br/>Please Note: Your peonies may arrive in bud form but will open in 1-2 days, meaning you can enjoy your blooms longer! Flower color may vary slightly from the pictured bouquet and may gradually change as your flowers bloom.<br/>If your foliage looks slightly dehydrated upon arrival, place the stems in some water to revive them. (Pro tip: remove any foliage near or below the waterline for a longer-lasting bouquet!)</span><br/></p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>1) Find a Vase:</strong> You may have noticed your flowers no longer have roots, and that they\u2019re not in soil. Bet they\u2019re thirsty! Time to put them in your favorite vase with some fresh water.</p><p><strong>2) Trim Those Stems:</strong> Keep those stems trimmed! Always cut your flowers at an angle so they can absorb more water &amp; won\u2019t suffocate on the bottom of the vase. After the initial cut, check the bottoms of your stems every couple of days, and if the ends are looking a bit slimy, just snip off an inch or so.</p><p><strong>3) Remove Leaves:</strong> Take off any excess leaves so that all the water is funneled into the petals. Pay special attention to leaves below the water line because they\u2019ll decompose, causing rot and bacteria to grow, which will shorten the lifespan of your blooms.</p><p><strong>4) Remove Spent Blooms:</strong> Any flowers that are past their prime release ethylene gas which will age the flowers around them. Remove any flowers that are beginning to wilt to keep the rest of your bouquet fresh and happy.</p><p><strong>5) Keep Them Cool:</strong> Last but not least, keep your flowers in a cool area. Don\u2019t put them near radiators, computers, televisions, fireplaces, ovens\u2026 you get the idea.</p>",
