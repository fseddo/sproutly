The Sweet Birthday brings the celebration with a breezy, coastal-inspired bouquet and a box of eight legendary Levain Bakery cookies. With four classic flavors and that iconic crispy-gooey bite, these cookies are a party in every box. Paired with bright, joyful florals, this gift set feels personal, elevated, and ready to make their day (and week). It’s gifting made easy and delicious.</span></p><p><strong>Allergens</strong>: Contains dairy, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts)</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em>Levain Bakery cookies are made by hand using shared equipment, which processes dairy, eggs, peanuts, soy, tree nuts and wheat. If you have a severe allergy, please know that while we do our best to prevent cross-contamination, we are not an allergen-free bakery.</em></p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>Cookie Care:</strong></p><p>Cookies may be stored in an airtight container for up to one week or frozen if not enjoyed immediately. For maximum enjoyment, warm the cookie in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes or until gooey. Of course, if you simply can’t wait, then 20 seconds in the microwave should do it. If frozen, they’ll take roughly 5-10 minutes in the oven — but trust us, it’s worth it.</p><p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">To ensure everything arrives at its best, your flowers and cookies will be delivered in two separate packages, but both should land on your doorstep soon! Please note, your cookies will be arriving directly from Levain's bakery and so if your order is placed after 1 PM EST they will be shipped to you the following day and could arrive after your floral delivery. This product does not qualify for free shipping.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p>Many of us know turmeric as a delicious spice with numerous health benefits. While that remains true, it’s also our double yellow orchid elegantly displayed in a sleek, black ceramic vessel. Excellent for adding a touch of autumnal luxury to any space, these stunning turmeric-shade orchids exude poise and appeal. Upgrade your space or a loved one’s this fall, everyone deserves this refined beauty.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Place your orchid about 1 - 3 feet back from a South or West facing window to ensure the plant gets bright light but doesn’t get burned by the direct sun.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your orchid with 3 ounces or 2 ice cubes of water every week. In most cases, this will work. Occasionally, you’ll want to check the dryness of the potting medium (the moss the orchid is planted in). If it’s very dry, give the plant a more thorough watering.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ALWAYS water below the leaves. If water flows into and sits and the center of the leaves, it will lead to crown rot and kill the orchid. If water does get between the leaves, soak it up with cotton buds or tissue. You can also blow gently into the meeting of the leaves to remove this water. Notes &amp; Tips: Keep me warm! Orchids are very sensitive to changes in temperature. If your orchid is exposed to cold (under 55 degrees) for more than 10 minutes, the unbloomed buds will begin to “blast” – turn yellow and shrivel up, and eventually fall off the plant. There’s no reversing this once it’s happened. Consider sending fresh flowers or another plant during the winter months. </p>",
