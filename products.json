Delicate yet uplifting, it’s sure to brighten anyone’s day.</p><p>While we strive to deliver all our bouquets as seen online, weather does occasionally impact the growing season for some of our specialty stems.

Always cut your flowers at an angle so they can absorb more water &amp; won’t suffocate on the bottom of the vase. After the initial cut, check the bottoms of your stems every couple of days, and if the ends are looking a bit slimy, just snip off an inch or so.</p><p><strong>3) Remove Leaves:</strong> Take off any excess leaves so that all the water is funneled into the petals. Pay special attention to leaves below the water line because they’ll decompose, causing rot and bacteria to grow, which will shorten the lifespan of your blooms.</p><p><strong>4) Remove Spent Blooms:</strong> Any flowers that are past their prime release ethylene gas which will age the flowers around them. Remove any flowers that are beginning to wilt to keep the rest of your bouquet fresh and happy.</p><p><strong>5) Keep Them Cool:</strong> Last but not least, keep your flowers in a cool area. Don’t put them near radiators, computers, televisions, fireplaces, ovens… you get the idea.</p>",

For maximum enjoyment, warm the cookie in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes or until gooey. Of course, if you simply can’t wait, then 20 seconds in the microwave should do it. If frozen, they’ll take roughly 5-10 minutes in the oven — but trust us, it’s worth it.</p><p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">To ensure everything arrives at its best, your flowers and cookies will be delivered in two separate packages, but both should land on your doorstep soon!

    "description": "<p>Known for its serene white blooms and deep green leaves, this plant serves as a graceful addition to any interior space. Its understated beauty makes it an especially thoughtful choice for sympathy sends, offering a lasting tribute of comfort and peace. Ideal for both gifting and personal enjoyment, this Peace Lily is more than a houseplant—it's a gesture of heartfelt care.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Peace lilies tolerate light levels from low light to bright, filtered light. In general, your plant will grow more quickly and push out more flowers in brighter light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can burn and blanche the leaves. Eastern and southern exposures are the vibe.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your plant when the top 2-3 inches of soil are dry to the touch. Peace Lilies are very slow drinkers, and you’ll probably find that you’re watering your plant every 8 - 12 days, depending on the light and warmth in your home. Peace Lily leaves will begin to droop if the plant becomes very dry but will pop right back up after a drink. Don’t let this happen too often tho, as it stresses the plant.</p><p><strong>Notes &amp; Tips:</strong> The white “flowers” that we’re used to seeing on Peace Lilies aren’t flowers at all. They’re called a spadix, which is a structure that protects the actual flower – the prickly little thing inside the white spadix.</p><p><strong>Pet Safety:</strong> Philodendron and all aroid plants are not pet-safe. Place on a high table or shelf away from furry companions.</p>",

    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Anthurium prefer medium to bright light, but I will push out more flowers in brighter light! Place your plant near or in a western or southern facing window so that it gets 3 - 6 hours of bright light per day.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your plant when the top 2 inches of the potting soil are dry to the touch. Usually this will be about every 8 - 12 days, but it could be less often in humid conditions. Misting your anthurium a couple of times a week will help it flourish as well.</p><p><strong>Notes &amp; Tips:</strong> Keep an eye out for what can look like little cobwebs on plant leaves. This is a telltale sign of spider mites, which enjoy nibbling on anthurium. Keeping the plant well watered and misting will discourage these pests.</p><p><strong>Pet safety:</strong> Anthurium and all aroid plants are not pet-safe.

    "description": "<p>Easy does it. The Breezy is a parlor palm—a classic, low-maintenance plant known for its graceful fronds and air-purifying powers. It thrives in bright, indirect light but is totally chill with lower light too, making it a perfect fit for living rooms, bedrooms, or that spot near a north-facing window. Housed in a neutral ceramic pot with a glossy reactive glaze up top and a textured matte finish below, it’s the perfect mix of smooth and grounded. A little tropical, a little timeless, and very easy to love.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light</strong> - Moderate light - ideally, this plant wants to sit in a spot where she'll get bright sun in the morning, and diffused light through the afternoon. Usually eastern or southern exposure works best.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Water</strong> - Water when the top inch of soil is nearly dry to the touch. For palms, specifically, avoid hard water or water rich in minerals. If you notice browning foliage tips, try watering with distilled water.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun Fact</strong> - This plant is called a \"parlor\" palm because&nbsp;it was a very popular plant in English parlors during the Victorian period.</p>",

Eastern and southern exposures are the vibe.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your plant when the top 2-3 inches of soil are dry to the touch. Peace Lilies are very slow drinkers, and you’ll probably find that you’re watering your plant every 8 - 12 days, depending on the light and warmth in your home. Peace Lily leaves will begin to droop if the plant becomes very dry but will pop right back up after a drink. Don’t let this happen too often tho, as it stresses the plant.</p><p><strong>Notes &amp; Tips:</strong> The white “flowers” that we’re used to seeing on Peace Lilies aren’t flowers at all. They’re called a spadix, which is a structure that protects the actual flower – the prickly little thing inside the white spadix.</p><p><strong>Pet Safety:</strong> Philodendron and all aroid plants are not pet-safe.

    "description": "<p>Moody and dramatic, this black ZZ plant (aka ‘Raven’ or ‘Supernova’) is anything but ordinary. Its lime green leaves deepen into a glossy black-purple over time, making it a bold, low-maintenance favorite in a bronzed pot that adds just the right amount of edge.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light</strong>- Prefers bright indirect light! Ideal conditions would be a sunny room facing south or west that’s filled with light for several hours a day. Northern or Eastern exposures typically will not be bright enough for me.</p><p><strong>Water</strong> - Please water me when the top 2 inches or so of my soil are dry to the touch. You’ll want to check the soil every 3-4 days, but do not add water that often.</p><p><strong>Notes &amp; Tips</strong> - I am a money tree (pachira aquatica) but am not related to Chinese Money Plants aka Pass Along Plants aka Pilea Peperomioides.</p><p><strong>Pet Safety</strong> - This plant is not pet-safe.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sometimes the most meaningful gestures are the simplest ones—The Neutral Orchids features multiple white orchids arranged in a clean white ceramic boat. Our designer created this serene arrangement for those quiet moments when you want to say \"I'm here for you\" without saying a word. Perfect for offering comfort during difficult times or celebrating someone who appreciates understated elegance. Beauty that speaks softly but says everything.</p>",
    "care_instructions": "<p><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Place your orchid about 1 - 3 feet back from a South or West facing window to ensure the plant gets bright light but doesn’t get burned by the direct sun.</p><p><strong>Water:</strong> Water your orchid with 3 ounces or 2 ice cubes of water every week. In most cases, this will work. Occasionally, you’ll want to check the dryness of the potting medium (the moss the orchid is planted in). If it’s very dry, give the plant a more thorough watering.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ALWAYS water below the leaves. If water flows into and sits and the center of the leaves, it will lead to crown rot and kill the orchid. If water does get between the leaves, soak it up with cotton buds or tissue. You can also blow gently into the meeting of the leaves to remove this water. Notes &amp; Tips: Keep me warm! Orchids are very sensitive to changes in temperature. If your orchid is exposed to cold (under 55 degrees) for more than 10 minutes, the unbloomed buds will begin to “blast” – turn yellow and shrivel up, and eventually fall off the plant. There’s no reversing this once it’s happened. Consider sending fresh flowers or another plant during the winter months. </p>",
